# Automate Boring ERP Feedback

## ?_?

It fills out `Theory` and `Practical` feedbacks without you having to do any work at all! It randomly selects a rating between 9 to 6 (inclusive). Your credentials are only used to authenticate you. (You shouldn't use your primary password anyway, connection to the website isn't over TLS!)

## How do i use it?

1. `make install`

2. Edit the script and put in your username and password for ERP

3. Run the script either using IDLE or commandline as `python3 main.py`

4. Enter the captcha you see in IDLE or commandline

5. Here be dragons ;)

## To remove the downloaded files
`make rm`
